Looking for more about you.

It's a support role.

Why you want to work for Home Office.
    Opportunity to work a job that has some actual social responsibilities and impact.    
    I think I could contribute to the Home Office's goals of internet mobilisation.
    I think it would be an incredible boost to my career, with the technologies available.
    I think the structured organisation of the Home Office would allow me to work.

Interest in technology and the role.
    Always been interested in tech. Backend interest started when I was younger - how the server side operates, as opposed to how the client side looks.
    

Something about you that's interesting.

Have a project ready to show off.

Have questions for them.
    What learning and development opportunities are available, where does it go in the next 3 to 5 years.

Don't mention "DevOps" by name as that's not where they're currently at.

L1: Admin / menial tasks / customer facing issues
L2: Diagnosing issues - logs, monitoring, finding the issue.
L3: Can be escalated to higher level if L2 can't do it.
